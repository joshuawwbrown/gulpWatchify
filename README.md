# gulpWatchify

A simple .gulpfile that watches your file, browserifies it, reactifies it, uglifies it, and then beeps

### All the things:

The things this script does include:

  * Watch your file for changes
  * Browserify your file
  * Reactify your code
  * Uglify your code
  * Save your new bundle to a file
  * Cache the results for zippy speed on your next code changes
  * Beep once on success, three times on errors
  
Feel free to comment out uglify for development if you have a fast connection or if you are working locally. You can remove the beeps or coloring if you like, too, but I find it handy!
